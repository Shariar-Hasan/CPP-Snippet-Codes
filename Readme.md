To use a snippet, simply start typing the snippet name and select the appropriate suggestion from the IntelliSense menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut associated with the snippet (which is displayed next to the snippet name in the IntelliSense menu).

In addition to these snippets, this extension also provides a number of other features that can help you during competitive programming contests:

- Auto-completion of common C++ keywords and syntax
- Make your typing faster
- Syntax highlighting for C++ code

To access these features, simply open a C++ file and start typing. You'll see suggestions for common C++ keywords and syntax, and you can use the extension's custom templates to quickly generate code for different programming challenges.
